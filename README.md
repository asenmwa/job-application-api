# Job Application Submission API  

## Objective  
Build a RESTful API endpoint to handle job applications for software developer candidates.  

## Requirements  

### 1. API Endpoint Functionality  
- Create a **POST endpoint** to accept job application submissions with the following fields:  
  - Full Name (required)  
  - Email Address (required)  
  - Phone Number (required)  
  - Additional fields dynamically specified in the request payload (e.g., LinkedIn profile, portfolio links).  
- Accept file attachments (e.g., CV and cover letter in PDF format).  
- Validate input for:  
  - Required fields.  
  - Proper email and phone number formats.  
  - File type and size limits (only PDFs, max 5 MB per file).  

### 2. Database Storage  
- Save all received data and attachments in a relational database or suitable storage system.  
- Generate a **unique job application token** for each submission.  
- Store the generated token alongside the application data.  

### 3. Email Notifications  
- Send an email to a specified address with:  
  - Application details.  
  - Attached files.  
  - The **job application token** for tracking purposes.  

### 4. Response Handling  
- Return a confirmation message to the applicant upon successful submission, including the **job application token**.  
- Provide meaningful error messages for invalid inputs or missing data.  

### 5. Job Application Confirmation  
- Create a **GET endpoint** that accepts the **job application token** as a parameter.  
- Respond with the details of the submitted application (fields only, no attachments).  

### 6. Security  
- Encrypt sensitive data in the database.  
- Validate all inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).  
- Ensure file uploads are securely handled and scanned for potential threats.
